# Word2Vec Implementation and Analysis on `robust-04` IR Data
## Henry Stachowiak and Robert Chatterton

Files:

`embeddings.json`: Our saved word embeddings. All tokens have been stemmed, and there are no stop words.

`train.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook that contains our implemention and training algorithms for our Word2Vec model. Much credit in regards to building the neural network goes to [this article](https://jaketae.github.io/study/word2vec/).

`retrieval.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook that contains the testing and analysis of our own model, as well as the analysis of FastText embeddings, GloVe embeddings, and a simple "CTRL+F" style search.
