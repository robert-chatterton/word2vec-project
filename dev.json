\n ( more on this disappointed person's dashed expectations later ) . \nas jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past . \nwhile he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole . \nit turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can't trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that \" glimmer man \" thing . \nan increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole's former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons . \nthe glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en ) . \nit's the other changes that disappoint . \nfor example , although there's a fair amount of violence in this movie , there's also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television's \" in living colour . \" \nwayans plays whiney straightman to seagal's bead-adorned and brocade-draped cole , keeping up his \" are you crazy \" part of the dialogue with wasted zest . \nas campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner's eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal's wooden comebacks make for painful watching . \na cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble . \nhe chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies . \nagain , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual . \nheck , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film . \nis that a lot to ask of the seague ? \ntoo much . \nseagal's best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages , and to do it silently , and alone . \nnot for seagal , the snappy one-liners of arnold and stallone , nor the attempts to show that he can act , much less think . \nno kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simple , unadulterated deathblows . \nthat's really how it must have started : like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing , knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else . \nwe trusted him . \nwe got to know him . \nnow , betrayal . \ni don't know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he's going to try to be funny again . \ni'll try , but it won't be easy . \nif you haven't watched the glimmer man yet , you might want to wait for the video to come out . \nit's easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences . \nafter all , if we can't depend on our fantasies , what can we depend on ?

{"id":"13710","class":"neg","text":"fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade . \ntragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies , but the quantity . \nmost of those movies were produced by cannon group , company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus . \nthose two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman , b- movie mentors of future hollywood legends . \nunfortunately , that didn't happened , and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade , behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage , that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal . \nsadly for bronson , that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead , and lowering his own reputation in process . \non the other hand , bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular , especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than bronson himself . \none of such movies that seriously marred bronson's reputation is death wish 3 , third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974 . \nin the original movie , bronson played paul kersey , mild-mannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence . \nthat movie was far from masterpiece ; yet , in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time ( on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry ) . \nunfortunately , six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels ; even the presence of its original director didn't stop the rapid decline of the quality . \ndeath wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend , living in the urban wasteland of east new york , populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out . \nbefore the reunion , kersey's friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker ( played by gavan o'herlihy , probably the only noteworthy role in the film ) . \nkersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade , while the police inspector shriker ( ed lauter ) , ants to use him as a secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime . \nbronson , the main asset in this movie , plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine . \nalthough bronson's charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities ( single man in his 60s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower ) , the lack of emotions or bronson's own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film . \nthe movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness , so they added romantic interest for their hero - public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kersey's crusade . \non the other hand , emotions are much better played by confronting law-abiding , yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks - ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks , and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey . \nunfortunately , michael winner doesn't know how to work out the plot , and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations , ends this movie with a bang . \nthe big showdown at the end - that turns east new york into the sarajevo-like battle zone - is probably the worst part of the movie , because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget . \nin short , this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia . \n ( special note for trekkies : marina sirtis , the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek : the next generation could be spotted in a small role of portorican wife ) . \n"}

{"id":"16325","class":"neg","text":"one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director sidney lumet's \" gloria , \" a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre . \nsuddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in . \nwhen a movie is over , aren't we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ? \ni thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn't have been anything to talk about in the first place . \nto be sure , \" gloria \" begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy's family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it . \nright before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with . \neventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment . \nmeanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn't commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime . \nwhen he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude . \ngloria is the type of fast-talking , smart-mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don't they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with . \nthe previous incarnation of \" gloria \" by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can't really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars . \nthere is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn't completely unbearable to watch . \ni liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again . \nthese bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers . \nthroughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , \" who really cares ? \" \nas gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over-the-top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn't sound realistic at all . \nin the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone's performance was , but as the film progressed she got better . \nalthough not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored . \njean-luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag . \nall other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria's friend whom she turns to for help . \nsony , the studio that released \" gloria , \" obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i don't blame them . \nthey declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high-profile people involved . \nalthough how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular \" in dreams , \" which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion \" gloria \" is going to vanish from theaters faster than \" ishtar , \" judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p . m . showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself . \nalthough stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995's \" casino \" or 1996's \" last dance \" if you don't believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of \" gloria \" was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful . \n"}
{"id":"12182","class":"neg","text":" \" tarzan and the lost city \" is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while . \nnot only it is poorly written , badly acted , and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas , it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid . \nunfortunately , it's not bad in the way great , colossal misfires like \" heaven's gate \" ( 1980 ) or \" ishtar \" ( 1987 ) were bad . \ninstead , it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with , which begs the question of why it was made in the first place . \nwith all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ? \nof course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984's \" greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes \" ) down to the really bad ( 1981's \" tarzan , the ape man \" with bo derek ) . \nmost of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps . \ntherefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others . \n \" greystoke \" added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even \" tarzan , the ape man \" at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek's bare breasts . \n \" tarzan and the lost city , \" on the other hand , has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue . \nthe script , by bayard johnson and j . anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come . \ncomic books have better plots than this . \nthe movie is so bad , in fact , that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer's comedy \" george of the jungle . \" \ndidn't the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ? \nthe story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes , and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage . \nwhen the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week . \nhowever , when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa's last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle . \nat first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man . \nonce the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city . \nmost of the so-called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of . \nthere are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from \" raiders of the lost ark \" ( 1981 ) to \" the goonies \" ( 1985 ) . \nwhen the movie is running short on action , it includes a few greenpeace-friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals , releasing a baby elephant from a trap , and throwing ivory tusks into the river . \nthe movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality . \nfor instance , when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra , he doesn't even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do . \ninstead , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival . \nof course , one can't help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is . \nnot to ruin the ending or anything , but there is no lost city . \nthere is , however , a lost pyramid , which i suppose is all the resource-strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-tv movie ) . \nwhich also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid , when it's sitting right out in the middle of an open field ?

\nabsolutely none . \nthey were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie . \nthen we have the actors . \nlili taylor has never been one of my favorites . \nand when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark . \ni have no idea why liam neeson took this role . \nhe basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus . \nhis character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him . \ni have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman . \nzeta-jones was cast because she is too hot for words . \nthe fact that her character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake . \nall catherine has to do in this movie is look good . \nfortunately that is something she does very well . \nwhile she does have a fairly good size part , it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye-candy . \nit's too bad someone of her talents wasted them here . \nany random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role . \nthe haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999's horror movies , the blair witch project . \nthe haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget , while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares . \nboth prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film . \nif the story sucks , it's all downhill from there . \nmy advice ?

{"id":"25971","class":"neg","text":"paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i'd consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who's managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils . \nstarship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that's nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage . \nit's not a completely successful film , but as a failure it's certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one . \nmy favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters , a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( haven't yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight ) . \ni believe his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero that's as touching as schwarzenegger's in t2 . \nthat movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics . \nits violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience . \nthere's a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him . \nhe tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim's every fearful tic . \nit's a startling moment of barbaric , maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir . \nin hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won't shut up , he impales a co-worker , drowns another and so on . \nbut why ? \nhis character is introduced as a smug genius , the kind who's always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear , sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place , though once the character becomes invisible , this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster . \nthe kind who just won't die . \nhollow man's protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda ( elizabeth shue , acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover , a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who's saddled with the film's worst lines ( \" i've lost cohesion again ! \" ) . \nthey're a typical aaron spelling couple , good-looking but as vacant as george w . bush's republican national convention speech ( i . e . \nbush referring to clinton ; \" ?

\nahh , what a cynical time we live in ? ? ? \nas the picture opens we meet cain ( kevin bacon ) , an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret ( so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation's ) project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility ( for what purpose is never hinted at ) . \nthey've performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine , in a twist worthy of the film's 1950's late show origins , to impulsively experiment on himself . \ncaine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co-workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead . \nour mad scientist is turned invisible ( after several fx-heavy complications ) , then he inexplicably ( it's hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures , but this is never explored , and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human ? ) \nbegins raping , assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases , always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger . \nit grows abundantly clear with each new release that it's verhoeven's films that have become hollow . \nlike the rest , this one is cold , heartless , and full of contempt for humanity , but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit , insight and makes no statement other than \" audiences will pay for anything these days \" . \nit's an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level , or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun , thrill-a-minute ride . \nverhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care . \nthe previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick . \nhow can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self ? \na couple weeks ago , after seeing the trailer , a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability . \nhollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa , in a serious manner to boot . \nbut oh yeah , it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway . \nverhoeven delivers the sleazy \" goods \" , but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner , here it just feels icky and uncomfortable . \nthe director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses , caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux-psycho music strains in the background . \nit's plainly obvious that verhoeven isn't exploring voyeurism ( like in the classic peeping tom ) but exploiting it and not even doing that very well . \nit's funny that with all the technology $90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman's naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand . \nmost vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks . \nin fact it's largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since , by the end , most of his potential victims don infer-red glasses that track his body heat . \nas in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov ( a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre ) , and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked . \nthe film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy . \nit happens when a lab assistant ( kim dickens , who looks like she stepped out of playboy ) in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon , suddenly pauses . \n \" are you looking at me ?

\nwrong . it's all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches . \ni must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves , but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them , much less a organized framework for all the \" wacky \" goings-on . \nspice world jumps from vignette to vignette , subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense , at one minute having the girls meet with aliens ( no joke ) and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride . \nwhile a decent joke slips through the cracks here and there--during a \" dance bootcamp \" scene , the girls sing the lyric \" we know how we got this far/strength and courage and a wonderbra \" --much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level . \nsome gags are just plain pointless , such as roger moore's recurring role as the mysterious chief , who dispenses cryptic , metaphor-heavy advice to clifford . \nthe only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond . \nha ha . \nas weak as the script is , i think there's one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie , and that is the girls themselves . \nthe point is not that they can't act ( and , for the record , they really _can't_ ) but that their individual personas , which works as a gimmick over the span of a four-minute music video , are too thin to survive outside of the truncated , video bite mtv world . \nposh ( who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions ) comes off best by default because her persona ( rich bitch ) most easily translates into character in a film . \nbaby's persona ( young innocent ) , to a lesser extent , also works , but the remaining girls' identities are a little harder to flesh out . \nthere really isn't much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often ( which is _exactly_ what fuller and spiers do ) , and , after all , what exactly entails being \" ginger \" or \" scary \" ?

{"id":"8584","class":"neg","text":"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nit's rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylor's first feature film , dream with the fishes , when the plodding , tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup . \nany hopeful expectations , however , are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatched-buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the film's latter half . \nthe film's central characters are terry ( david arquette ) , a depressed , lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident , and nick ( brad hunt ) , a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill . \nnick lives in the apartment building across from terry , who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz ( kathryn erbe ) with his trusty set of binoculars , but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half-drunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge , unconvincingly vowing suicide . \nnick casually asks for terry's wristwatch , and eventually cons terry into a trade - the watch for a bottle of pills . \nof course , terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects , and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch . \nlearning of nick's condition ( he only has a handful of weeks left ) , terry's compassion kicks in , and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement - terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick's lifelong fantasies , and nick will fulfill terry's death wish by killing him . \nthis is a promising premise , and mr . taylor's film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point , but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters ( terry is a repessed , mournful character who wants to die , while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live ) and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits , and where the straight-laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character . \nthis is by-the-numbers plotting , buddy movie/road movie redux . \nhowever , dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline , but by the characters which carry the story - it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic , if not likeable . \nunfortunately , that is not the case here , where both of the film's leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying , giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights , and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits . \nfar from a romp , this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt , and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond . \nmr . taylor's dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes - while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone , it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived ( witness such lines as \" you should have asked something more interesting , like 'do you enjoy the pain ? ' \n- see , that's provocative , leaves room for further questions . \" ) \nthe film enjoys a few inspired moments - the urn scene , a session of nude bowling , the policeman joining in on terry and nick's acid trip - but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between , and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes . \nthis occurs particularly often during the film's opening sequence - as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital , i'm realising that this is * intended * to be funny , although nary a smile crept upon my lips - which is probably due to the obvious fact that it's painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts , sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick's scheme of tricking him ; this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes . \nthe entire sequence is , then , clearly an exercise for character exposition , with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability . \namong the cast , coming off best is david arquette , the current master in the portrayal of meek , squirming , stammering fresh-faced characters - he would have been terrific as the lead for george huang's swimming with sharks - who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry . \nmr . taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique , where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated , as opposed to a bright , crisp look for the smalltown scenes . \nthe charge of dream with the fishes's protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me ; i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters , and indeed , in many cases have i been in the minority , supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult , audience-unfriendly nature of their characters . \nfor dream with the fishes , though , i did find myself on the flip side of coin , often hoping that the film would quickly conclude , and that the nick character would just hurry up and die . \n"}

? ? ) over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow . \nthe main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred . \nthe film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape ( one where it is consensual the other where it is not ) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off . \nthis is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently , and if memory serves me i can't think of one film that has done so , and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80's next to wall street . \nunfortunately nobody gives us reason to care , not the writer , the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off . \npaul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here , though boogie nights succeeded . \nit was similarly moralistic , but it gave us two different viewpoints ; it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters , and it showed us the possible fall-out of such a decision . \nthe characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here , but anderson seemed to care about them . \nhe gave them heart . \ncristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones . \nhe preaches to us , by using his characters to preach to us . \nthis is not the way to get any message across . \nwhy not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin' skins ?

{"id":"6035","class":"neg","text":"depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawa's 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leone's 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line . \nnew line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons . \nthe fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ . \nit also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself . \nthis time around , the man with no name is played by bruce willis , a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico . \nby all appearances , jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town , with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border . \none is headed by an irishman named doyle ( david patrick kelly ) ; the other is run by chicago-connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg ) . \ncalling himself john smith , the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle's side . \nbut smith's allegiance is as uncertain as his name , and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them . \nviewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations . \nthere is the happily ineffectual lawman ( bruce dern ) , the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses' affections ( karina lombard ) , the barkeep who becomes our anti-hero's only friend ( william sanderson ) , suspicious lieutenants ( christopher walken and michael imperioli ) to question the bosses' trust in smith , a brutal beating , and a big fire . \ndirector walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn't try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture . \nwhat he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice-over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction . \nyes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling . \nthe problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters . \nthey were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status . \nwith john smith's voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane , just another tough guy trying to stay alive . \nit feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn't work . \nthe narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence , and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence . \neven if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction . \nwillis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else . \nchristopher walken plays doyle's brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos , and there isn't another single character whom makes even the slightest impression . \nwith no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build-up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about . \ncinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill's 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration . \nsometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original , they'll wonder what all the talk was about . \nin the case of last man standing , it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about . \n"}

) , do yourself a favor and rent this gem that puts more good use to kudrow in sixty seconds than \" hanging up \" does in its entirety . \nas eve's hardworking husband , adam arkin is , predictably , squandered with a role that gives him next to nothing to do , until a subplot reveals itself midway through , only to never be mentioned again . \ncloris leachman , as with ryan and matthau , makes a small , but noticeable impression with her , albeit , very brief appearance , while edie mcclurg , as a rosy-cheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas 1988 flashback , manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production . \nnearly all the emotions displayed within \" hanging up \" are patently manufactured , and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the characters , aside from eve , why would you want to when they are all spoiled brats ?

\ncasting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with . \nschwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea . \narnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions . \nin other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake . \nharrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they've all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger . \nthere are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho's character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine's location by offering him his old life back . \nnone of these scenes really work , because arnie isn't up to the task . \nthe filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before . \nthis one isn't at all believable the way arnold plays him . \nthe supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all . \nas the prince of darkness , he's suave and confident . \nhe acts like one would expect the devil to act . \nthe problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain . \nbyrne out-performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil . \nbyrne's speech about the bible being \" overrated \" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold's attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the \" 'tis not ! \" \nvariety ) are feeble at best . \nthe only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares . \nkevin pollack plays jericho's security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour . \nrobin tunney isn't given much to do except look scared . \nin fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do . \nperformances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it . \nthis being an action blockbuster , it's no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it's utterly ridiculous . \nwhy is the devil coming on new year's eve , 1999 ? \nbecause it's exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn't 666 , it turns out . \nsome nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you've got 1999 ! \nif you don't buy this explanation , you're not alone . \nit's convoluted and silly at the same time . \nthe method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she's christine , see , and she lives in new york , see . \n . \n . ) , and if that weren't bad enough , there's plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn't explained at all . \nwhy can satan kill everyone he passes on the street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex-cop , he's powerless ? \nis he impervious to only one kind of bullet ? \nhow come he can't control jericho or christine ? \nand how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies ? \na clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this , but it's never actually explained . \nusually , this sort of thing wouldn't matter in a schwarzenegger flick ( i mean , don't get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies ) , but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting . \nthere are several predictable horror film clich ? s present in \" end of days , \" complete with the old \" black cat hiding in a cabinet \" bit , not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there . \nit gets so formulaic that it's possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a \" boo \" will come . \ntheir predictions will rarely be wrong . \nthe more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless , partially because we don't care about these characters ( due to the script's pathetic attempts at characterization and setup ) , and also because they , too , don't make any sense . \nthere's a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady . \nit's good for a few chuckles , but not much else . \nsupposedly we're to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan , but the script never sets that up , so the scene is merely silly . \nnone of this is terribly exciting , because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it's often hard to tell why it's happening in the first place , not to mention that they're edited in full-on incomprehensible mtv quick-cut style . \nmost of them had me scratching my head , rather than saying , \" wow , cool ! \" \n \" end of days \" is not only silly and confusing , but it's also distinctly unpleasant to watch . \nthe devil apparently doesn't operate in the more subtle , i'll-convince-people-to-kill-each-other fashion outlined in the bible , but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight . \nthis doesn't only make him an awfully predictable sort , but it also means that not a single scene in \" end of days \" goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence , or the odd kinky sexual encounter ( yet another bit that had me scratching my head ) . \nif violence is supposed to be shocking , it's not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb . \nscenes aren't connected through any reasonable means , so a lot of the time , stuff gets blown up , or people get killed , and i had no idea why . \nreasons ? \nto hell with reasons ! \nlet's just blow stuff up ! \nisn't it cool ? \nnope , not by a long shot . \nthis film is thoroughly unwatchable . \nit's dull , interminable , and unrelenting in its stupidity . \nperhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career , because it's not happening with hack peter hyams here . \n \" end of days \" might have had camp value , if only it didn't top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody's going to buy . \nif the movie is going to be serious , the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script . \nif it's going to be campy , arnold shouldn't be taking himself so damn seriously ( i didn't actually see him put up on a cross , did i ? ) , and his character shouldn't be such a sad sack . \nas it stands , \" end of days \" is just a bad movie , and an awfully gloomy one at that . \n"}

\nmuch of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson's book , and there are some priceless comic observations . \nbut you're hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work . \nthis brings us to the performances , which strike me as all wrong . \ndepp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c . scott in patton - a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson's dialogue . \nin between his several puking scenes , del toro fares better as dr . gonzo , but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost . \nwatching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago , with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see . \nit's interesting to note that alex cox , credited as a co-writer on the screenplay , was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over . \nas much of a fan as i am of gilliam's work , cox would have been the better choice . \nsid and nancy , cox's best work , covered essentially the same subject matter , but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film . \ngilliam commits the compound sin of over-directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose . \nwhat kind of movie was he trying to make , anyway ? \nit doesn't try to be a cautionary tale , and it doesn't work as broad comedy . \nif he had considered more carefully his purpose , the result would have been a much more interesting film . \nbut i don't want to be too hard on it . \nthere are some truly funny moments , and if you're in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it . \ni do , however , recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance - i guarantee it will enhance the effect . \n"}

that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good . \ni'm happy to say that there's something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs . \nin fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours . \nthe film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island . \nted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can't seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w . \nearl brown ) , who's being harassed by one of the school jocks . \nit seems warren's sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted's willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up . \nmary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom . \nted was just flattered that she even knew his name . \nunfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital . \nfast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn't seen since that fateful day . \nwith the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love . \nhowever , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections . \nthere's something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin . \nnot exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them . \nwith their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you'll not only enjoy , but also won't mind talking about the next day at the water cooler . \nthe film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers' last two films ) they almost all work . \ni have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on . \none minute you'll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you'll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary's apartment . \none of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller . \nhe is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he's a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation . \nted's a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don't always work out . \nit's comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top . \nactually , i've liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties . \nthe film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money . \nin it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler . \nit was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived \" the ben stiller show \" on the fox network in late '92/early '93 . \nlike \" the critic \" ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show's cancellation . \ncameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times . \nhowever , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she's got guys just falling over each other to be with her . \nheck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week . \nmy girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn't change , and you know , it's really true . \nhe and ralph macchio must hang out or something . \nmaybe they live in dick clark's pool house . \nanyway , here's another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary's heart . \nthe supporting performances are also good . \nchris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy . \nlin shae , who plays mary's neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film . \nlee evans , as mary's friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist . \nthe farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren't any noticeable times where the film drags . \nthe only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes . \nthey appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera . \nit's a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film . \nafter that it got a

\nthe film confronts all these problems , paradoxically , by not cronfronting them . \nit doesn't simply plug in the \" right thing \" at the \" right time , \" it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant . \nbuilding a strong foundation is important to all forms of media , without which , what is there to build on ? \nwe're given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters , especially our main character , scarlett o'hara ( leigh ) , a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel , a cunning wit , and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time . \nshe knows how her society works , wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her . \nright from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be . \nbeing the most sought-after woman allows her to manipulate men ( and their women ) to ensure she gets her way , whether it be obvious ( i . e . \nwho will be the one to get her food ) , or subtle ( i . e . \ngetting married just to spite someone ) . \nthe man she claims to love is ashley wilkes ( howard ) , a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him . \nhe isn't so arrogant and demanding as scarlett , in fact , he's engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his . \nher name is melanie ( de havilland ) , and she is one of the sweetest , kindest , and most likable characters one will ever see . \nshe and scarlett become very dear friends , but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her , and the love she has for her husband . \nher meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic - it defines who she is , but doesn't give her much emotional self-defense . \nacting a catalyst to the love triangle , and to the story as a whole is the daper , stong-willed , cunning , cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler ( gable ) . \nhe's quite a character all right - everyone listens to what he has to say even though he's got a bad reputation . \nbutler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior . \nhe tells everyone the much-needed truth in the rigid caste-like society where freewill doesn't seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition . \nfor example , in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there's no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out . \nthis angers them , not for his lack of faith , but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that . \n \" do we have ammunition factories ? \ndo we have food ? \ndo we have a navy ? \nall we have is tobacco . \" \nall true statements and yet the south still insists he's wrong . \nbutler is a shifty character to be sure , but he takes such pride in his arrogance it's appealing . \nscarlett notices this too when she first sees him , and from the look butler gives her , we know he's not going to stop until he has her . \nbut scarlett can't get past her need for ashley , and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story , butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever . \nand so the story goes on , with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life . \nthe conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband , especially after she is \" marked \" for life when her first husband dies . \nthis gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story . \nsome are vital for only a few scenes , but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film . \nin most films only a few characters exist for support in background , but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance . \neven people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set . \nthe costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place . \nthe filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside , real world , but these types of simple approaches are never taken . \nthe first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war . \nfleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is . \none scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming , \" no ! \nnot my leg ! \ndon't cut off my leg ! \" \nanother scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street , but as the camera pulls back , we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers , but it is their moaning that's more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be . \nas the second half begins , the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single-handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north . \nshe manages to resurrect the family plantation , but all the willpower she has can't help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south's ultimate defeat . \nthis brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love- hate relationship . \nmost of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett . \neach uses the other for personal gain , but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other . \nscarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can't help but want her more every time she tries to one-up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business . \nthey say opposites attract , but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities , it borders on magnetic polarization . \nthey need each other and know this , yet they never seem truly happy together . \nperhaps they mistake love for passion , and the film leaves it up to us to make this call . \nboth have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other . \nlove and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film , we're left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why . \ngable and leigh do have great chemistry , always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture . \nall ?

{"id":"5009","class":"pos","text":"driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small , intimate story . \nit's a quiet film , a slow film , a deliberate film . \nbut if you're patient with it , the movie offers innumerable rewards , such as a pair of self-assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy . \ndriving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry's pulitzer-prize winning play of the same name , which first opened in new york four years ago . \nthe play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago , los angeles , london , vienna , norway , and the soviet union . \nuhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy ; he also penned the wonderful sleeper , mystic pizza . \nthe film , like the play , is set in atlanta , georgia , and it revolves around two people in their twilight years : a cranky , 70-something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man who becomes her chauffeur . \nthe movie relies on character , rather than plot , to propel the action . \nin fact , the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense ; it doesn't present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together . \nrather , driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life : shopping , listening to the radio , visiting the cemetery , eating fried chicken , and so on . \nthe film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta's history , including the 1958 bombing of the temple ( the city's oldest jewish congregation ) and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr . martin luther king , jr . \nthe story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway . \nthe insurance company cancels her insurance , and her son , boolie , decides to hire her a chauffeur . \nfreeman , reprising his role from the play , plays the chauffeur , hoke . \nthe film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger . \ndriving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it's about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon . \ndaisy is strong-willed and set in her ways , and , from the outset , she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur . \ninitially , she treats hoke with contempt , refusing to let him drive her anywhere . \nonce she does get in the car , daisy is the ultimate back-seat driver . \nto make matters worse , she is extremely self-conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand . \neventually , however , daisy is worn down by hoke's good-natured charm and infectious cheer ; she softens and opens up to him . \ntandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well , but unfortunately this feisty , cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace . \nwe've seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations , from on golden pond to cocoon . \nnevertheless , tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own . \nfreeman , as hoke , on the other hand , gives the more distinctive of the two performances . \nthere is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color . \nhoke is uneducated and illiterate , but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man , an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior . \nboth freeman and tandy seem to be in their element , in full command of their natural charisma . \nthey flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves . \nthey bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie's gentle humor . \nat the same time , tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama . \nin his first dramatic role , dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie , tandy's loving and patient son . \ndrama seems to agree with aykroyd ; taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor , especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ( ghostbusters ii , the great outdoors , my stepmother is an alien ) . \nthe only other significant characters in the film are daisy's housekeeper , idella , marvelously played by esther rolle ( \" good times \" ) , and boolie's pretentious wife , played by patti lupone . \nunder the direction of bruce beresford ( crimes of the heart , tender mercies ) , driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again . \nbut fortunately , beresford never forgets he's shooting a movie , and accordingly , he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches , such as gorgeous shots of flowers , trees , and tomatoes . \nin adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen , the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety . \nuhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say . \nberesford wisely exercises restraint in the film's dramatic moments . \nthe movie tugs at your heart , but it never goes for the jugular . \nthe only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees . \n"}

when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft-focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio . \nin terms of the story itself , \" the horse whisperer \" gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean's \" a brief encounter \" ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood's 1995 adaptation of robert james waller's \" the bridges of madison county \" ( richard lagravenese , co-screenwriter here also adapted \" bridges \" ) . \nalthough \" the horse whisperer \" has a strong romantic sensibility , i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story . \nit seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who's being left behind for this brief , heart-sweeping affair , but there rarely is . \nin \" the horse whisperer , \" the thankless role of being the fuddy-duddy husband falls to sam neill . \nhe plays the character as a decent , hard-working man who is a good husband and father ; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him . \nhe is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away , but simply because he happens to be a normal , fairly uninspiring man . \nthere is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character . \nit shows booker and robert going into a horse pen - booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out-of-place in a baseball cap . \nas they enter the pen , booker assuredly swings over the fence , while robert hesitates , then opens the gate and , in a goofy moment , forgets to close it behind him . \nit's a small scene , but it clearly demonstrates the movie's thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness . \nafter all , booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it . \nthe best scenes in \" the horse whisperer \" tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie , but rather the healing process of grace and her horse . \nalthough booker's horse-training methods are mythical and unrealistic , the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing . \nthese are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace , some of which are humorous , and all of which are tender and true . \nat some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more . \nnevertheless , redford is obviously a romantic at heart , and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film . \nthere are no dramatic sex scenes , but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow-dancing , always moving ever closer together , that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together . \nalthough the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character , there are enough moments like that which make \" the horse whisperer \" worth the price of admission . \n"}

the sixth sense . \" \nstylishly filmed and tautly directed by \" x-files \" alum james wong , the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters ( in accurately written \" teen-speak , \" rather than overwrought , highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn't use ) , all the while developing into a darkly foreboding , severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less-successful , but still suspenseful epilogue . \nat the start of the film , 17-year-old high school senior alex browning ( devon sawa ) is about to leave with his 40-student french class for a field trip to paris . \nprogressively getting a case of preflight jitters , he

exploding upon takeoff , and after causing a ruckus onboard , he , as well as six other students and a teacher , are thrown off . \narguing in the airport lobby , alex's suspicion comes true when the

decide his fate . \nalex's best friend , tod ( chad e . donella ) , wants to stand by him but can't because of his fearful parents . \nthe teacher , mrs . lewton ( kristen cloke ) , is frightened by him , believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster , as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker . \nonly outsider clear rivers ( ali larter ) , who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alex's premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before , is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life . \nthat is only the setup of \" final destination , \" and the less said about what follows , the better . \nsuffice to say , the film does , indeed , turn into a slasher film , albeit one that is more thoughtful than most , and replaces a knife-wielding maniac for the never-seen granddaddy killer of them all , the grim reaper itself . \nthe setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes , and \" final destination \" surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years . \ngraphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner , they manage to occasionally be so intense you don't know whether to shrink down in your seat , tap your feet in nervousness , or turn away . \ndevon sawa , a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999's underseen slasher-comedy , \" idle hands , \" is even more of a charismatic presence here . \nthe conflicting emotions he feels for his survival , which he comes to believe he wasn't meant to do , as well as the loss of the other passengers , is superbly and subtly acted on his part . \none scene , in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful . \nali larter ( 1999's \" varsity blues \" ) , in the other central role , is also effective , as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before , leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man--the exact opposite of her now-deceased father . \nthe other roles are not as fully written , and most remain rather one-dimensional . \nthe movie is mainly sawa's , however , and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles . \ntony todd ( 1992's \" candyman \" ) , as an arcane morgue attendant , pops up for a five-minute cameo , but his appearance is rather supererogatory . \nand the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye , while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy . \nultimately , what is so good about \" final destination \" is that , within the confines of the slasher genre , writer-director wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner , and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frighten--two things that are

later , an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert . \nmatilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale . \nit is also characteristic of the best children's tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don't realize that they are learning them . \nthere is a hilarious moment when matilda's television-addicted father snatches away the book she is reading ( in a wicked joke , he thinks _moby dick_ is pornographic ) and forces her to watch an inane game show ( hosted by jon lovitz ) in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around . \nmatilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment , and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because \" i'm big and you're little , i'm right and you're wrong . \" \nmore specifically , it has as its heroine an intelligent , self-confident girl who struggles successfully against other people's notions of how she should behave . \nit is no coincidence that matilda was co-written by robin swicord , who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women . \nfinally , matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment : it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word . \ndevito knows enough to make matilda fast-paced and appealing to children , taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy , including a great chase through her dark house . \nthe child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable , with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character . \nbut there are also many , many delights for adults , including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda's classmates recite in sing-song fashion ; there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda's father . \ni can't imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted . \nmatilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling . \ni will see it again , and years from now i will watch it with my children . \nand now i will stop , because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin , and there is a seat in that theater you should be in , if you have a child or ever were a child . \n"}

{"id":"26269","class":"pos","text":"let me open this one with a confession : i love cop movies . \ni adore them with such an unwavering , near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998's one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers , steven . \nwas it any good ? \nwell , just about as good as baldwin's steven seagal impression ( for those i've confused the answer is a resounding no ! ) . \nnow let me clarify , i don't love just any cop movie ; i'm not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80's and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker . \ni'm partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection . \nproblem is these films come along just about as often as george w . bush makes a cogent point so whenever a \" true \" cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail . \nso what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7 . 50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ? \ntruth is i'm a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches . \nyes it's all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i'm guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from . \nas little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe's , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc . the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos . \nas an adult my tastes haven't changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a \" guy \" film could potentially bring . \nnow what if it's the cops who're the corrupt ones ? \nooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain . \nthrow a courtroom drama ( yech ! ) \ninto the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city . \nhow absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ? \nso damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved . \nthe film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at . \nsince i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn't . \n ( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves ) . \nlike mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn't make it to where he should have . \n ( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell ) . \nhere , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino's in serpico ( also directed by lumet ) . \nwilliams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-juliani streets of new york . \nthey work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes . \nand that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done . \nthe squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice . \ndanny has done this , and though he's a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way . \nhe seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a \" double agent \" . \nhe does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners . \nright away we know that that is exactly what he'll have to do . \nand watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be . \nundercover cop films are almost innately exciting , even the kind that pull out all the cliches ( like in too deep ) . \nhow can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal , ambiguity , and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position ? \nprince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat . \nlumet's greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action . \nhis scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking . \nlumet's worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension . \nthis isn't as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet's most recent cop \\ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching . \nthough of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot . \nsome of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic . \nhollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable . \nof course cop movies aren't popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) , but just look at the average hollywood action movies , flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn't gay , the lame comic relief character who's never funny , and on and on . \nfor all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \\ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills . \nit focuses completely on its story , and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies . \nthere's a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he's about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches , but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing . \nthis is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human , excuse me , weak . \nin the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out . \nhe's lost his voice . \ndoes that little itty bitty detail matter ? \nmaybe not to most , but it sure made my night . \nand in a sprawling epic of corruption , greed , betrayal and violence it's nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things . \n"}

{"id":"10862","class":"pos","text":"satirical films usually fall into one of two categories : 1 ) long-term satire where everything , including the jokes , is somehow related on a large scale ( i . e . \n \" dr . \nstrangelove \" ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i . e . \n \" men in black \" ) . \nwhat's unique about \" wag the dog \" is that it doesn't necessarily fit either of these descriptions , and yet is both at the same time . \nthe result is a clever comedy based on an original , smart premise , even if the focus does tend to wander a bit . \nif there's anything that affects americans the most it's politics and showbusiness . \nin this age of information and technology , we've been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things , it's gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it . \nwe need the media to bring us the most up-to-date news , but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking . \nthis film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas , and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics , the media coverage of politics , and the entertainment industry are so closely related , couldn't someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all ? \nthat's the idea conrad brean ( de niro ) , a professional washington spin doctor , comes up with in order to restore the president's good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election . \nbrean , along with the president's top advisor , winifred ames ( heche ) , fly to california to meet up with hot-shot movie producer stanley motss ( hoffman ) . \nthey pitch him an idea to \" produce \" the image of a war with albania ( it's a country no one's heard of so they people will buy it ) . \nsoon the wheels are in motion and the film's riffing satire comes into play . \nwe're inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation , such as a folk singer , visual and sound effects technicians , and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leary ) . \nthe initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv , in the movies , or in the news . \nthe characters' dialogue is witty and funny , although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom-esque . \nfor example , one scene shows motss and brean's production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee . \nmotss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry , but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs . \nsince it's all computer-enhanced anyway , she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later . \nthis demonstrates the film's ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise . \nbut then there's the gags and one-liners that , although are humorous , seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress's name , or , whenever a problem emerges , always responding with , \" this is nothing ! \" \nby the time the film makes it to the midpoint , everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens . \nthe first act is quickly paced , while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film . \nevery ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with , and it's always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it . \nthe screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head-on in realistic manners . \nhowever , it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject . \nas the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture . \nwhat had started off as a brilliant , somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie . \nstill , the situation comedy is quite funny , especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt . \nwillie schumann - a war hero motss and brean concocted . \ntruly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time , but think about afterwards and \" wag the dog \" at least succeeds in this respect . \nhowever , in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done , namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes . \nthen again , it's a valiant effort . \n"}

coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such . \nwithout words , this sequence gives us a background to her character . \nfollowing , however , is a set-up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives . \ni don't know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn't have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie's beginning , but there it is . \nif there were ever a clear case for \" less is more , \" this would be it . \nthe film is told nearly first person from william's point of view , as he is in every scene . \nby nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily . \nin fact , much of notting hill's strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis . \na scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he's even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his refrigerator . \nor take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image . \nwilliam assures her he wouldn't say a word , then adds , \" well , i'll probably tell myself now and then , but i'd never believe it . \" \ngreat stuff . \nthe downside to spending so much time with william is that we don't get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible . \nwe're constantly exposed to william's thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but don't actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him . \nthere are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we're not sure what she's been thinking all the times in between . \nthis , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant's film hands down . \nhe gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance . \njulia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress's top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character's unpredictable behavior . \nanna doesn't get a lot of our compassion . \nthis romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance , much of it supplied by grant himself , but with considerable help from the supporting cast . \nmost notable is rhys ifans as spike , william's eccentric roommate , who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh . \nhugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william's friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister's birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst . \nit's a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation . \nroger michell's use of visuals doesn't sweep us off our feet , but does give us more than your typical movie of this type . \nfor example , there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass . \nwhereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying \" eight months later , \" michell presents us with more interesting cues , such as william's walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him . \nanother memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air . \nwe're generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird's eye view of the ground below . \nmusic is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film's scenes , and some of this might have been better toned down , but in other areas it works to full effect . \nit's kind of a mixed bag , but still fares better than many of today's lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video . \nat least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate . \nnotting hill's grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all-time greatest film pairings , but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it . \nfor a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that's not so bad , now is it ? \n"}

\neveryone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless ) . \nthat seems to be the basic theory behind `go , ' where several characters' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways . \nin order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors . \nthese types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out . \nhow they will all come together is the process the film deals with . \ni'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general . \nthe film starts out as anything else , with little indication of what's to come . \nwe meet ronna ( polley ) , a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn't seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent . \nshe's not very charming , especially to her customers , but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works . \nmaybe this is because she's not a very afeminite character , but she's far from masculine - a creative character indeed . \nthings start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy , hyperactive , yet likable simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences . \nthis agreement starts a three-pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug . \nthe process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death . \nnearly the same can be said for two other characters , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don't think much of when they first appear as supporting characters , but later will become major players to the film's makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be . \nonce the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle . \nwhen the title screen `ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene , it's clear this film isn't going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling . \nconsidering how good it is up until that point , it's a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today . \nand so the film begins to take shape , first by following ronna and her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam ( who were actually looking for simon ) , which doesn't exactly go as planned , but that's what keeps it all so interesting . \nthe second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna's story , but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead . \nsimon and his three friends head to ? vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined . \nthe third arc , about zack and adam , again overlaps with ronna's story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle . \nwe're shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna . \nand many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren't even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were . \ni'd really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end , but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven't seen the film . \nperhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability , and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay , just through great filmmaking . \nstill , i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well : \n ? direction : trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman , it's a great accomplishment . \nhe doesn't just depict a story , he wraps us up in it all , pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low . \n ? screenplay : besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general , it's clear the script has been inspired by many sources , with both obvious and subtle references , yet it never screams `rip-off . ' \n ? tone/mood : where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream , this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre . \nit's not overly-dark or twisted and the comedy isn't so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy , more like `macabre light . ' \n ? cinematography/art direction : able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner . \n ? characterization : for nearly every character introduced , no matter what role they play in the big picture , we're able to get a sense of who they are , what they're thinking and how they came to be in their situations . \neven when their actions are surprising , it never seems very out of synch . \n ? performances : every actor nails their role ( see above ) . \n ? theme/theory : the film doesn't seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages , instead , it's more of a philosophical experiment . \nin fact , it might not have meant to do that intentionally , but there definitely is something existential to it all . \n . . . and to think that `go' is just a big comedy and adventure ! \n ( 4/23/99 ) [see also : `the big lebowski , ' `clerks , ' `jackie brown , ' `pulp fiction , ' `true romance ; ' also by liman : `swingers'] \n"}

if he's not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese , he's making wind-bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement , \" america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium . . . . \nblah , blah , blah . \" \nwhen the film opens , it is a few days before the 1996 primary elections , and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become . \nin a fit of desperation , he takes out a $10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino ( part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee ) , and then hires a hit man to kill him , although he doesn't know who the assassin will be , or when the hit will take place . \nknowing that he will soon be dead , bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world , which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general . \nat a compton church , he tells the group of african-americans that they will have no power in the u . s . unless they \" put down that malt liquor and chicken wings , and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife . \" \nlater , in a particularly hilarious sequence , bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite , then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he's there is because \" my guys always put the big jews on my schedule . \" \nall throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade , bulworth's chief of staff , dennis murphy ( oliver platt ) , follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment . \nplatt has some of the movie's funniest scenes , as he makes murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet . \nhis constant half-truth-telling and spin-doctoring to cover bulworth's stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self-righteous reporter ( nora dunn ) who acts like murphy's refusal to explain bulworth's actions ( something he really cannot do ) is somehow an act of treason . \nwhen bulworth decides he wants to live after all , and therefore must constantly evade a grim-looking assassin to be who's trailing him at every turn , he hides out in the ghetto , complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews . \nat this point , beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the black inner-city experience . \nbulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina ( halle berry ) , who he meets at the harlem church rally . \nshe has a tough-talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l . d . \n ( don cheadle of \" boogie nights \" ) , who also becomes involved in bulworth's campaign . \nsome of the scenes in the ghetto ring true , but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense inner-city films like \" boyz'n'hood \" ( 1991 ) and \" menace ii society \" ( 1993 ) . \n \" bulworth's \" chief liability is beatty's insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device . \ninstead of speaking at political rallies , he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip-hop stars are black . \nit's hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad , or whether he's actually that incompetent . \nat any rate , the rap sounds more run d . m . c . \nthan snoop doggy dogg , which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary . \nbeatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner-city lingo and working that into his speeches , instead of trying to sound like l . l . cool j . \nother than that , \" bulworth \" hits all its targets with wry , hilarious accuracy . \nthe film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party , and even if you don't agree with beatty's liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government , it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics . \nunlike \" primary colors \" which opened earlier this year , \" bulworth \" doesn't try to tip-toe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home -

{"id":"5126","class":"pos","text":"the laserman : somehow the title of writer-director-producer peter wang's film conjures up images of superheroes , like ultraman and spiderman . \nyou kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips . \nas it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren't any superheroes . \ninstead , wang's film is populated by a group of refreshingly off-beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city . \nthe laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity , eccentricity , and electricity . \nthe film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese-american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment . \nhe loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds . \narthur's professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas . \nhis personal life , on the other hand , is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives . \nin fact , arthur is by far the blandest character in the film , despite a charismatic performance by hayashi ( the san francisco-based actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii ) . \nit's the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark . \narthur's not-so-typical jewish mother , ruth , for example , is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body . \nshe has dyed her red hair black , she takes herbal medicine daily , and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies , such as matzo balls in soy sauce--the ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine . \nveteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it , almost stealing the movie in the process . \nshe plays ruth as a driven woman , determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture . \narthur's girlfriend janet ( maryann urbano ) is a kooky free-spirit who would rather meditate than copulate ; her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation . \narthur's best friend , joey ( tony leung ) , is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns . \njoey is married to arthur's jewish sister , but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house . \narthur's 11-year-old son , jimmy , played by the amazingly adorable david chan , is--horror of horrors--bad at math ! \nhe finds it impossible to meet his father's lofty expectations . \nthe various people in arthur's life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity . \nlike wang's earlier film , a great wall ( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china ) , the laserman revolves around cultural differences . \nevery character in the film is , in some way or another , trying to find his identity--struggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way . \nthe movie also offers a provocative look at technology . \nwang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu , a detective who is fed up with machines , even though he relies on them to do his job . \nthe film views technology with a wary eye , acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers . \nwang raises the time-honored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions . \nwas einstein responsible for the a-bomb ? \nis arthur weiss responsible for his lasers ? \nthe movie pits spirituality against technology , man against machine , and the result is a draw . \naccording to the film , technology has its place , but we must employ it with great forethought and caution . \nironically , by its very nature , the laserman is a triumph of technology--the technology of filmmaking . \nwang's direction is exquisite , especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically cross-cuts between the various subplots , perhaps in homage to d . w . \ngriffith . \ncinematographer ernest dickerson , who has worked on all of spike lee's films , gives the laserman a distinctive , artistic look . \nmason daring's score , which includes a send-up of bach , is right on target . \nthe laserman is an ambitious endeavor , which is to be applauded , but it's sometimes ambitious to a fault . \nwang serves up so many slices of life in the film that it's hard to digest them all . \nfor instance , one character ( arthur's sister ) has negligible screen time , and consequently we just don't care about her marital problems . \nin weaving his web , wang has included a few too many strands . \noverall , however , the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction . \non the surface , the film is a light and bouncy comedy-thriller , overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style . \nthe heavier issues emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film . \nyou can ponder the moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town . \n"}

{"id":"8207","class":"pos","text":"contact ( pg ) there's a moment late in robert zemeckis's contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place . \nwe see a scientist , dressed in a silvery space suit , walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact , spherical space pod , unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops . \nanticipation , excitement , anxiety , fear--the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character , nervously , breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead . \nit is this sense of discovery , the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration , that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical , captivating entertainment . \njodie foster stars as dr . ellie arroway , a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals . \nand i mean life--after losing her entire family when she was young , the only thing occupying ellie's world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth . \nafter dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers , ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega , which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport . \nfrom this synopsis , contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci-fi hook . \nthe alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe , but perhaps more than anything else , contact is a character study of ellie , whose obsession with empirical , scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power . \nthe irony is that , while admitting to having no religious faith , she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes , in a sense , a religion in its own right . \nit would be easy for scripters james v . hart and michael goldenberg , in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine , to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones , but they wisely eschew easy answers , giving equal time to both sides , and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane . \nin the end , there is no right or wrong , nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other , even slightly so--there are just two very viable points of view , each with their own merits , each with their own faults . \nthe complex role of ellie is an actress's dream , and foster , a virtual shoo-in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year , more than rises to the challenge . \nshe conveys intelligence , determination , warmth , and , in a gutsy move , always on edge . \nwe root for ellie and feel for her , but we also feel at times that she goes too far . \ncontact is clearly foster's vehicle , but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles . \nmatthew mcconaughey , who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role , holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie , spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss ( however , his main storyline , the tentative palmer-ellie romance , is the film's weakest subplot ) . \njohn hurt is effectively creepy as s . r . \nhadden , the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding . \nangela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine . \nmost memorable of all , though , are tom skerritt and james woods , who play rival scientist dr . david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz , respectively ; both , especially skerritt , embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances . \nzemeckis comes off of his three-year break in top shape . \nalways known as a director of effects-laden extravaganzas , it comes as no surprise that contact's visual effects are quite stunning . \nthe central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001 : a space odyssey , but with more advanced technology at his disposal , zemeckis's voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick's yet more wondrously pure . \nand zemeckis doesn't resist the urge to use the always-interesting incorporate-actors-into-existing-film-footage effect , which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump . \neffects , however , are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama , emotion , and pure wonder , which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump . \nit says a lot that , in a summer science fiction film such as this , it's not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised . \nthe thought-provoking , two-hour-plus contact is a much-welcome change of pace from summer no-brainers , but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isn't entertaining . \nfor all the interesting questions it asks , the film is still what it's being sold as-- \" a journey to the heart of the universe . \" \nand what a fascinating , unforgettable journey it is . \n"}

\nhe is someone they have never met before , but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account , it is their only reason for coming to the convention . \n \" the big kahuna \" revels in salesmen-talk among the three white christian males , two of them , larry ( spacey ) and phil ( devito ) , who are veteran salesmen , having teamed together for the last twelve years , while bob ( facinelli ) is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department . \nthese three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna , as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite . \nthe three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job , and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life . \nthe outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why . \nwhat comes into question is their opinions on life and death , on god and morality , and on how they make a living . \nthese are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch . \ntheir dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical . \nfollowing in the long tradition of salesmen films -- from death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross , as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high . \nin this case , it is landing the big kahuna . \nthey each are trying to see why he's on top and why they are chasing after him . \nwhat makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product . \nand how after each one's psyche is stripped clean by the other , there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each . \nthe goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna , but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen . \nlarry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life . \nbob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ . \nhis vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in . \nbob is a baptist , who takes a very non-questioning and literal attitude about religion . \nto just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin , according to the way he reads the bible . \nwhen asked by larry why he married his wife , he seems puzzled and can't even say because he loves her , only that marriage is something sacred to him . \nthe contrast in their personalities is stark . \nlarry is all business , he simply wants to close the sale . \nhe comes into the room pumped for the convention , using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman . \nhe criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burned-out . \nhe tells him to go on a vacation . \nget a woman . \nwhile phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change , now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife , after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long . \nhe now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in . \nhe has always been a charmer , shaking everyone's hand , trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale . \nlarry is more aggressive as a salesman , he is always a heart attack away from every big sale . \nin contrast , bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him . \nthis is his first time for him on the road . \nwhen dick fuller doesn't arrive at the party the salesmen throw , larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering . \nwhen told that he spoke to the secretary , larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account . \nbut when they start talking to bob , whom they forced to act as the bartender , they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another man's name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus . \nbob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards , and that he invited bob to attend . \nlarry and phil can't fathom how bob didn't make a sales pitch . \nbut they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller's attention about their company's product as

\nwow ! \nmike myers' third role is as fat bastard , a scottish henchman of dr . evil's , who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers' frozen body . \naustin powers learns of dr . evil's trip back into the 60s , and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967 , to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it . \nonce arriving in the year 1967 , austin travels to his \" pad \" , his smashing home/dance club , where he meets felicity shagwell , played by heather graham , a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr . evil . \nas the film progresses , hilarious one liners are thrown at us , mainly by dr . evil , for example , \" don't go there , girlfriend ! \" \nto the president of the united states . \nmany witty gags take place , note the entire tent scene , and just plain , funny scenes which are so stupid- they're funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes . \ntake for example , scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is . \nthe way austin powers : tswsm uses its humor is clever , throwing a hilarious scene at you , followed by five minutes of one liners , followed by another outrageous scene , so you never stop laughing . \nthere was honestly not one moment in austin powers : tswsm where i wasn't laughing . \nthe last film that i laughed so hard in , was well , austin powers ! \nit is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it . \nthe film even makes fun of itself in a line , something along the lines of , \" it's funny how england and southern california look nothing alike . \" \ntswsm was filmed in southern california , but was supposed to take place in england . \ni can tell you one thing- he is having a lot of fun with this enormously popular character , which is all over television , newspapers , magazines , and the movie theaters . \ni believe that dr . evil got more attention in the tswsm than austin powers did . \ndr . evil provided more laughs , more memorable moments , and more interesting dialogue than austin did this time around , who seems to missing the funny touch that he had in the first film . \ni felt that austin really did have his mojo taken away , but from screenplay writer mike myers , not fat bastard . \nalso making a great addition to the series is mini me , who is played by verne troyer . \neven though the midget actor is 30 years old , he is adorable by dr . evil's side constantly . \nthe first austin powers film had barely any sentimental quality , such as lack of character development , barely any detailed plot characteristics , and barely any good acting , but austin powers tswsm actually shows some quality behind the frequent humor . \nmike myers , with his three roles , acts as eddie murphy did in the nutty professor , disguising himself completely in one of the roles . \n ( fat bastard ) all three characters are different , and mike myers does do a good job handling each one of them . \nheather graham made a great addition with her talent to tswsm , and does a much better job than elizabeth hurley did , who gave a very flat performance in the original , speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion . \nspeaking of hurley , she can be seen in tswsm for a few brief moments . \nhopefully , graham tags along for future austin powers adventures . \nthe bottom line- a groovy sequel that mike myers put all of his mojo into writing . \n"}

) , and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely . \nthe visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far . \nall of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre . \nit's a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across--the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously . \n"}

the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times . \nfor others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade . \nbrilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides . \nhis travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence . \nhis pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain . \nhowever , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen . \nbut despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against \" scum \" is something that average person wants , but doesn't have a stomach/lack of brains to do it . \nwhile de niro's travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel . \nwizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america's better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he \" knows stuff \" . \nhis obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade . \nother characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age . \nmatthew \" sport \" ( keitel , who befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ;

\nwell , most of the time , these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person . . . that \nis , their boss . \nso all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence . \nbut this film brings the betrayals , the messed up loyalties , the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package . \nof course , director paul mcguigan isn't trying to be guy ritchie here , and doesn't over-stylize his presentation , jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix . \nnope , he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this . \nthe first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he's attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty ! \n ( \" look into my eyes ! \" ) \nin fact , the last time that i've seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers' miller's crossing . \nscary shite . \nbut there's an ever better scene than that in this film . \nthis one features bettany , once again , slowly torturing , hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man's point-of-view ) , but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes , one by one ( that's right , he \" does \" the guy in his underwear ) . \nthat scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film , especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss ( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman ? ) . \nbut the flick's not perfect . \nin fact , i didn't mind malcolm mcdowell's voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot . \nall he seemed to do was swear and call people the c-word umpteen times , and even described one scene as it was happening ( \" . . . so \ni opened the door , then went up the lift , etc . . . . \" -it's \nlike , yeah , i know that already , i could see it on the screen ! ! \noverdone . ) . \ni also didn't quite \" buy \" the ending of the movie , which despite being original , seemed a little unbelievable , especially when you consider that it's supposed to be taking place 30 years later , and folks still seem to be holding grudges , still in love , still living in the same apartments ?

{"id":"4041","class":"pos","text":"showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer . \ntheir last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry-spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone's taste , but certainly a well-crafted movie . \npossibly that movie's greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie . . . \nand that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters' future , so there was no need to film it . \nthere was actually about four hours' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on-screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails . \nthe major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls . \nwe have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who's trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do . . . \nbut recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner . \nin this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who's not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we're left feeling good about her future . \nthis is not one of the great movies , but it's far better than we'd been led to expect by all the negative pre-release publicity . \nverhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 , and in the last quarter-century has pushed farther and farther , experimenting with the socially-acceptable limits to movie-making . \nhis most recent three movies , robocop , total recall , and basic instinct , have been a progression of back-door access to american culture , moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives ; and now he's exploring the sleeze . \nthis movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director's contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie . \n ( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating , although his original version is available on video . ) \nmany reviewers have taken the politically-correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies , it's about people in an environment where naked ladies are common , and why such an environment should exist . \nit's about the scum who use other people as power-trip toys , and the need to escape their power . \nit's about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don't pertain ; and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment . \nan nc-17 movie which isn't sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty , power , or value . \nthe one scene in the movie that * could * have been a good sex scene , berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool , is not exciting , because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator . \nif anything , it's a rape scene with a victim who's been duped into cooperation . \nyou don't make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors ; you don't make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed ; and you don't make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls . . . \nand in an awful lot of vegas shows , an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing . \nthis is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry , in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity . \nshowgirls de-glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness . \nnomi is played , in a very good performance , by elizabeth berkley , who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who's at the end of her rope , desperate to live a life better than the one she's known . \nshe has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability , and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker , trying to be something better than she seems destined to be . \nwhen nomi realizes she's gone too far for too little , she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be . \ngina rivera plays molly , a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi , providing her with what may be the one solid , positive relationship in nomi's entire life . \nmolly is the one who makes the difference , and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she'll be using for the rest of her life , and nomi's feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi's decision . \ngina gershon plays cristal , an aging , but still very attractive starring dancer , a reflexively competitive manipulator who's become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her . \ngershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch ; a fading talent made bitter by self-awareness . \nher character is very well drawn and performed ; in a major scene in a hospital room , she acknowledges what she is , and , in essence , passes the torch to nomi . \nthe relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie , and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path . \nit is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe ; molly is an honest , hard-working person who means well , and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality . \ncristal is a talented dancer who's compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co-operating part of the system , exchanging self-respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas . \nnomi believes she can make it without selling herself , succumbs to a degree , and then realizes she can make it without selling herself , and doesn't need las vegas or its brand of \" stardom . \" \nthe male parts in this movie are simply props ; they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist . \nkyle maclachlan , whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden , gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs , camouflaged as a nice guy . \nglenn plummer plays a dancer who's working as a bellboy , and provides a bit of alternate perspective . \nplummer's character is the only one in the movie who's maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art , but even he's succumbed to the cult of manipulation . \nplummer's character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie . \nsome of jost vacano's cinematography is fantastic , and one particular delineation of nomi's character alteration , a no-dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting , is utterly terrifying . \nthis movie is rated nc-17 due to language , sexual situations , full frontal nudity , violence , and probably the costuming as well . \ni don't see a way this particular story could have been told well without it , and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie-making . \nbut don't go see it if you're not in a tough mood ; the only person it's possible to like in this movie ends up in an i . c . u . \non life support , and there is probably not one character in this movie you'd enjoy meeting in person . \n"}
{"id":"10837","class":"pos","text":"i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of \" good will hunting \" , based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film , in which the main character will hunting ( matt damon ) , an mit janitor in his early twenties , is discovered to be an einstein-level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight . \nthe only problem is that will is a tough street kid who's had his share of run-ins with the law , and before long he's being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight . \nprofessor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problems in his lectures , tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police : will is to be released , provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions . \nthis sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff , but \" good will hunting \" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama . \na conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will's therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain , while sean wants him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been largely neglecting . \nwill finds that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau's attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle . \nhe also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) , an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her . \nwhat makes \" good will hunting \" work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will's life . \nthe script's sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong . \nlambeau , while he may seem a little cold at times , is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we're not sure if we like what he has to say . \nand sean , for all his warm-heartedness , has , as lambeau and later will point out , not lived up to his full intellectual potential either ; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will . \nwill's reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious \" right \" and \" wrong \" side and beating them over the head with it . \nfor a film with such an extraordinary character , \" good will hunting \" presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another . \nthis film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far-fetched situation . \n \" good will hunting \" also has its share of fun humor , such as when will , in an early therapy session , pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture . \nand in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa . \nwill's relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100+ uses of the 'f' word , which was most likely the reason for its r-rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will's character . \nadd all this to the fact that \" good will hunting \" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i haven't given this film four stars . \nwell , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original . \nthere are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic , including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions . \nstill , \" good will hunting \" takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would , and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years , and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of '97 films . \n"}

{"id":"27325","class":"pos","text":"in chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she'll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they'll most enjoy . \nsome scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before . \nthis can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat's true colors begin to shine through . \nmaking a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom's chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year . \nwhat gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom's 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what's on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences . \nthe bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness . \nchocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion . \nthe bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens . \nmany are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne's opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business . \non the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne's shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does . \nalso a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends . \njuliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character's determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat's success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses . \nlena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs . \njudi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin . \ncarrie ann-moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously . \nvictoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle down . \na trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : \" five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . \" \nthat's not to say the men don't do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne . \nthe technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film . \ncinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman's masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules . \nchocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter . \nwhile not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom's chocolat is a film which works on all levels-as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale . \nand it even lives up to its name : it is delicious to savor the taste of , easy to digest , and , like all excellent chocolate , it is memorable for days afterward . \nthe bottom line : chocolat is pure pleasure . \n"}
{"id":"21740","class":"pos","text":"there must be some unwritten rule that states , one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom , even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere . \nin the exotic morocco of 1972 , a 25-year-old english hippie mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girls , the 6-year-old lucy ( carrie ) and the 8-year-old bea ( bella ) , has arrived for a year's stay , with the self-absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband ( she is not officially married to him ) and her cold one-room london flat , and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech . \nat least she says she is , as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers . \nshe has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in . \ndrugs , a world-wide youthful phenomena during this period , where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the 'good life' cheaply , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities , even though drugs are illegal there . \nbut this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here . \nin this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken . \neven the ones coming here for spiritual reasons , to follow the mystical sufis , seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from . \nthe film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud's grand-daughter , esther freud , who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister . \nit is written by the director's brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie . \nthe title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls . \nwith julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her , she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria ; so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui ) . \nhe becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls . \nthe girls readily accept him , and there is no big-to-do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really don't know what to make of the relationship . \nit especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother's loose attitude and wants to go home . \nthings go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village . \nit seems only that bilal's charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there . \nthis scene didn't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also . \nbut i doubt that . \nthe family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel . \nlucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel , while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a 'normal' girl . \nthe beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets . \nkate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner , living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences , as many a drop-out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose . \nthe background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film . \nthe only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn , a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves . \nthe family's travel , which is on the edge , has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting ; but , when she gets up , all there is , is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her . \nthat marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is starting to wear thin in her thoughts . \nit will dawn on her , when bea takes ill , as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her , whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence . \nhe is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him . \nthe new guru is grounded in reality , something she is not grounded in , and seems to tell her what she couldn't comprehend from anyone else , even comforting her , by telling her that her tears are memories- a gift from god . \nthe film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia . \nthe storyline about a helpless single parent , detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby-boom generation had during their trip to morocco , who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism , a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers , contrary to the impression the film might give , seemed to pass her by . \nher knowledge of that trip is only surface deep , at best . \nshe perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . \nafter all , the mystical trip is the journey . \nthe film's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings . \nbilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity . \nthe little girls are precocious but they are lovable . \njulia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn't know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them . \nshe was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london , she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she's at . \nthis is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being . \nand , after all is said and done , who's to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was ! \n"}
{"id":"27523","class":"pos","text":"being the self-proclaimed professional film critic that i am , i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia ( coming soon to dvd ) until only recently . \nafter all , it's considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean , who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai , and doctor zhivago . \nso one day , a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it . \ni was initially skeptical that something made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the butt-numbing 3 1/2 hours of its duration . \nbut now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against -- the winner of seven academy awards in 1963 for best picture , director , editing , cinematography , art direction , music , and sound . \nafter watching the film again , i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen . \nbased on the autobiographical writing of british officer t . e . \nlawrence during world war i , lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence ( played by then-unknown actor peter o'toole ) as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever . \nbored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building , lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be re-assigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army . \nlawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war i . \nshot in panavision's famed super 70mm format , the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic . \nit is absolutely breathtaking . \nusing stunning cinematography , costuming , and direction , shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth , i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in 1962 and watch this story unfold before my eyes . \nevery shot is choreographed as a portrait -- a living tribute to a great land . \ndavid lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed , and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time , a far cry from its pathetic , uncreative existence today . \nafter watching the film , the first thing that came to my mind was , \" i've got to do a remake of this film ! \" \nbut then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modern-day movie executive : \" okay , it's going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert . \nwe are going to need to blow up a full-size train because computer-generated effects probably wont do it justice . \nand we are not going to use any big stars , and won't have any female actors since there's no love story . \" \nyes , my friends , the velvet curtain fell on the golden-era of hollywood a long time ago . \nbut at least we still have the proof to show all would-be producers and directors out there just how good a film can be . \n"}

{"id":"11053","class":"pos","text":"seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell ) . \nwhen it comes to modern gangster movies , it's really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word \" routine . \" \ni've always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it's been used before ) can provide for a good story and \" donnie brasco \" clinches this idea . \nit's not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another's style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale . \nthe film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it . \nwe meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk . \nhe and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this . \nsomehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn't afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him . \nit's clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade . \ni have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit . \nhowever , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer . \nthe first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to . \nthe screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original . \nmost gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable . \nthankfully the film doesn't become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development . \nmuch of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie . \npacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would . \nhe's old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be . \nwe learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it's easy to sympathize with him . \nnewell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run . \nas donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it's hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed . \nmost of the film tells the story of donnie's life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn't always seem to come together as a whole . \nthe storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar . \nthe resonance to donnie's actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn't always seem to have much meaning . \nback home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he's never a and the family is suffering . \nsince this is based on a true story i wouldn't doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic . \nmy only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure . \na climax of sorts does occur , but there's little feeling of a payoff . \nwe get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful . \naside from a few minor , general flaws , \" donnie brasco \" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development . \nit may be routine , but it's good , and that's respectful . \n"}
{"id":"10211","class":"pos","text":"it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival's palme d'or , a $100 million-plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination ? all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction . \nsince then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn . \nin between , he has moonlighted as an \" actor \" with several decidedly unmemorable performances . \nnow , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown . \nand , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard's novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed . \nfor the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie . \nthe story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses . \nand the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , '70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens' bare feet . \nyet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown . \nthe sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent . \nthe mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn't match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino's previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives . \nand there aren't nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around . \nthere's a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that's about it . \njackie brown's lone \" innovation \" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives . \nthis isn't exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa's rashomon and most recently in edward zwick's courage under fire . \nhowever , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino's sole purpose for using it appears to be because it's unconventional . \nhad the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost . \nas a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity . \nfor the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a '70s icon . \nthis time around , instead of john travolta , it's blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) . \nin one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier's career , tarantino uses a '70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits . \nthere are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) . \ngrier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states . \nshe's working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official . \nno longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv's \" banyon \" ) to post the necessary $10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal . \njackie passes ordell's test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 of ordell's money into the united states without tipping off the feds . \nsoon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell's perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) . \nunsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn't nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction . \nin addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) . \nrobert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile roles . \nbridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino's foot fetish . \nrobert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle-aged actor . \nthe film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) . \ntarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself . \nwhen it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second-tier effort . \nit's an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender . \n"}

they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts \" - excerpt from as you like it , act ii , scene 7 \nwhen william shakespeare penned this passage , he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent , or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash . \nthis is the world of today , and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical high-concept project like the truman show . \ntruman burbank ( jim carrey ) seems to have the perfect life . \nhe has a pretty , doting wife meryl ( laura linney ) , a comfortable insurance sales position , an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven , a reliable childhood buddy marlon ( noah emmerich ) -- except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia , this is paradise . \nor so it would seem . \nbizarre , inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in truman's life . \na lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky . \na rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term 'isolated' follows him around . \na radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move . \nfor the first time in his life , it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be . \nthe truman show , directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol , is a remarkably well-constructed film , paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next . \nbalancing drama with humour , thoughtfulness with abandon , this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy . \nin many ways , mr . niccol's screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca -- both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity , with pivotal , character-defining moments occurring at sea . \nalthough the film's rather conventional climax doesn't sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds , and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch , there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception . \ndespite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film , it remains foremost a finely-crafted piece of entertainment , constantly light and accessible . \nthe tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude , and as the carefully-stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down , the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false . \nthe end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable , crowdpleasing underdog vs . \nthe system formula . \nwhile the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept , some elements are lacking . \nthe device of mysterious lauren/sylvia ( natascha mcelhone ) as a contributing impetus to truman's growing awareness isn't exactly convincing . \nthere's not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves , and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ( ed harris ) with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience , thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film . \nin fact , although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside truman's artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers , it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even * more * deeply in the insulatory seahaven world , with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling . \nstill , the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target , and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti-voyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city . \ni've always believed that the versatile ms . linney possesses a tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes -- and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character , mischievously flashing a glazed , insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans . \ncheerfully going over the top , it's hilarious to watch her -- who would have ever guessed that she'd have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film ? \nms . linney is a delight in the film . \nbut it is mr . carrey who rules the show here . \nhe may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank -- the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts -- but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal : it's difficult not to root for truman . \nin a commanding performance , mr . carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence , and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn , demonstrating admirable restraint -- there's an early scene where he's down on his knees gardening , and given his past track record , one almost instinctively anticipates mr . carrey to pull one of more infamous , and in this case , wholly inappropriate sight gags . \nit's almost poetic how this notorious look-at-me actor successfully tones it down to play a character who's constantly the centre of attention . \nin addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- mr . emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman's antiseptic , white picket-fenced smalltown utopia , and by burkhard dallwitz's original score . \ntechnical credits are first-rate all around . \nwhile the truman show is clearly a definitive high-concept film , it's not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one -- obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound , ranging from 1965's secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner . \nall the same , this is a visionary , award-calibre film : entertaining , provocative , and intelligent . \nthe curious ( and possibly disturbing ) thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film's concept seems unfathomably outrageous , it's abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching , if not actualisation , at least permissiveness of such a scenario . \nperhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr . weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question . \nperhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world . \n"}

{"id":"16071","class":"pos","text":"bill condon's \" gods and monsters \" is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) , who made the horror classics \" frankenstein \" and \" bride of frankenstein . \" \nsince i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film , there is no way to know how accurate the film is , but i suspect that much of it only came from whale's inner fantasies and hallucinations . \nwhale , who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures , decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him . \nas the film tells it , during the end of his life , whale , at his large home in l . a . , became infatuated with the tall , handsome , and much younger man , clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) , who was working as the gardener at his home . \njames whale , we learn quickly was , what many people refer to him as in the film , \" a dirty old man . \" \nin one of the opening scenes , a young film enthusiast visits whale's home to interview him and whale agrees , on one condition : for every question he answers , the young man must take off an article of clothing . \nbecause of this episode , we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting , later making the excuse that his bright , white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off . \nclayon agrees , and doesn't really think much of this , much to the warnings of his friends , becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past . \ncertainly , the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall , since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man , even though boone is not gay , and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life , as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis . \n \" gods and monsters \" is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast , due to his sexual preference , and never got the recognition he would have liked , since he longed to be referred to as a \" motion picture director , \" rather than a \" horror director . \" \nand in one heartbreaking scene , he attends a party with boone being his guest , held by director george cuckor , and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore . \nit is evident that whale's first love in his life was making movies , and when his career ultimately fell apart , so did his passion in life . \nas played brilliantly by ian mckellen , james whale comes off as a sad , but dignified man , and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others , just as long as he knew he was being true to himself . \nhe never hid the fact that he was gay , however , even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession , and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person . \nthrough the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone , boone , of course , only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to , while it means so much more to whale , who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life . \nalthough boone is only in a dead-end job as a gardener of people's homes , whale views him as the ideal man , not only one that is good-looking , even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings , but one that will actually listen to him . \nsince whale lives with only his loyal , but disapproving maid ( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave ) , it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world , and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor . \nalthough an extremely fine and mature picture , a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness . \nit is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments , but it is a little thin , and the structuring of the \" on-again-off-again \" friendship at the film's center is fairly predictable . \nwe know early on where these two characters are headed , and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds . \nin lesser hands , this set-up might have felt too calculated , but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this . \nalso , a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar ( effectively played by lolita davidovich ) , but abruptly dropped and never brought up again . \nif the film was not going to follow up on this side story , then it , perhaps , should have been taken out altogether . \n \" gods and monsters \" is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture , impressively directed by bill condon , who , i sense , relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone . \nthe film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end . \nwalking away from \" gods and monsters , \" it was ian mckellen's marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me , and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably . \nit is a sad testament when a person's true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them , based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life , which , ironically enough , is no one else's business in the first place . \n"}
{"id":"29691","class":"pos","text":" \" through a spyglass , i could see everything . \" \nking louis xvi was beheaded on january 21 , 1793 , but instead of visualizing this act of regicide , legendary auteur eric rohmer's the lady and the duke observes from afar . \nconsider it a view to a kill made abstract . \na proper british ( yes , british ) gentlewoman , grace elliott ( lucy russell ) , and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris , where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants . \nthe maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope ( often muttering , \" i don't know , \" ) as the sound of cheering patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air . \nwhat we don't see might not be able to hurt us . \njust close your eyes and think of england . \nduring times of revolution , the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls , discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them . \nadapted from elliott's memoirs , journal of my life during the french revolution , rohmer's latest artistic tour-de-force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies ( tales of the four seasons , etc . ) , a period film set during the most violent changes in french history . \nresisting the temptation for grand-scale theatrics , much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . \ngrace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist : a headstrong , snobbish blueblood , one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along . \na foreigner who accepts the french king as her own , grace's life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover , the king's hot-blooded cousin , prince philipe , duke of orleans ( jean-claude dreyfus ) . \nthe times are changing , though , and the gears inch ever closer toward violence . \nduring the september massacres of 1792 , she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke's sister-in-law on a stake . \nrohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil , old fashioned , almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob . \nin doing so , he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not : the face of death . \nwhen grace sees her friend's disembodied head on a pole , rohmer's attention drifts from the societal change to one woman's reaction shot , laden with hot tears . \ngrace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice , sheltering him from the mob . \nthrough her relationship with the duke , she seeks a passport for this one activist's escape . \ngrace doesn't even understand her own actions ( and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger ) . \nshe endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers , ceaseless police monitoring , house searches , even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence . \nmaintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life ( her imperious attitude to the servants never changes ) , she becomes a heroine through circumstance . \nthe events themselves are intrusions upon her person , her home , and therefore her values . \naristocracy proves a glass house , one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones . \nthe duke is called to vote on the king's punishment , and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors , talk means nothing in the face of bloody action ( or futile inaction ) . \nthe episodic structure creates a wobbly , jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution , which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification . \nlazy viewers ( and critics ) may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke . \nthat's foolery , but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer's characters occasionally become didactic . \nrohmer's imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future . \nwhat may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmer's use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism . \nthe actors were filmed against a bluescreen , then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris . \nthis recreation calls attention to itself in every shot , a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wide-open streets . \nit looks as phony as titanic , but unlike james cameron's debacle , the lady and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone . \nwhy ? \nthey aren't real . \nthe very foundation rohmer's characters stand upon is false , and in their groundlessness they must discover themselves , in all their insubstantial glory . \nscreened at the 2001 new york film festival ( feature coming soon ) . \n"}
{"id":"9364","class":"pos","text":"one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable . \nyou know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is . \nsure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch . \nthis cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun . \none of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story . \nthis rule applies highly to kiss the girls . \nthere is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made . \nhowever , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through . \nwell , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up . \nunfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits . \nthat may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery . \nhowever , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film . \nplotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality . \nwe are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero . \nhe gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself . \nobviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene . \nat his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days . \nthis provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross . \nhowever , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees . . . \nbefore she is abducted . \ndr . kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself . \nbecause of these character-developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful . \nafter being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods . \nremembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out . \nwhen casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall . \nafter she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice . \nfrom this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive . \nmany people will compare this film to 1995's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional . \nthe screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form . \nwhat makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness . \nthe cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us . \nsometimes a simple shot is the best one . \nhowever , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight . \nthe scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way . \nthe camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well . \nthe chaotic and mtv-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd's character is experiencing . \nhowever , the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors . \nmorgan freeman is one of today's most powerful and believable actors . \ndetective cross is a very good character for him , although it is just a similar one to the character in seven . \nbecause of freeman's powerful presence , he carries half the film by himself . \nthe other half is carried by ashley judd , one of today's most promising dramatic actresses . \nin fact , her performance is better than freeman's , if that is even possible . \nher character is more original than freeman's , and she handles it wonderfully . \nwe finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream . \nthe supporting cast is highly underdeveloped , but the cast members do as much as they can with it . \ncary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina , and unfortunately has scraps for a character . \ntony goldwyn fairs slightly better , but we don't really get to know his character either . \ngina ravera gives a good performance , but again she isn't in many of the scenes . \nso as a result of all these small supporting parts , the weight of the film lies on the two leads , and they do a phenomenal job . \nsome of the best acting of this genre , and some of the best acting of the year . \ntwo other essential aspects of the film are quite good . \ndirector gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors , but the second half of the film loses believability , especially during the revelation of the killer . \nhe also doesn't handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have , losing a lot of tension during many scenes . \nhowever , to his credit , he does manage a terrific first half . \npart of the blame falls on david klass . \ni'm sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more , but klass focuses on the two main parts . \nwhile this may give the two leads more screentime , many of the small characters are one-dimensional , and the killer , when revealed , is extremely implausible . \nthanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel , kiss the girls always seems intelligent . \nnone of the conversations are laughable , and all move the plot forward without seeming forced . \none of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer . \ni blame this mainly on the casting director , because the killer's motive is because of rejection from women ( or so i assume from the opening monologue ) , but the killer himself is very attractive ( one of my friends is a , shall we say , big admirer of the killer ) . \nkiss the girls is rated r for terror , violence , language , and suggested sex . \nwith all the implausibilities of this film , and with the mediocre second half , kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain . \nin fact , i had the urge to see it again just for the performances . \nthe cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone , and the script is usually smart . \nthis is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through . \nmorgan freeman is possibly today's most convincing actor , and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt . \ni must also say that i loved the ending . \nthe showdown between good and evil was quite tense , and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer . \nperhaps it may not be possible , but most of the film isn't anyway . \n"}
